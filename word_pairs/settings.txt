i) The I/O format in each Hadoop task, i.e., the keys for the mappers and reducers:

* 1st map-reduce (word_freq):


Mapper:

Input: Line
Key: LongWritable
Value: Text
Output:
Key: Text (A+" "+B or "!"+" "+A)
Value: LongWritable (1)

Reducer:

Input:
Key: Text (A+" "+B or "!"+" "+A)
Value: LongWritable (1)
Output:
Key: Text (A+" "+B or "!"+" "+A)
Value: LongWritable (count of the key)

* 2nd map-reduce (pair_freq):

Mapper:


Input: Line
Key: LongWritable
Value: Text

Output: 
Key: Text (A+" "+B or "!"+" "+A)
Value: LongWritable (count of the key)

Reducer:


Input:
Key: Text (A+" "+B or "!"+" "+A)
Value: LongWritable (count of the key)
Output:
Key: Text (A+" "+B)
Value: Text (count of A+" "+B+" "+the count of A)

* 3rd map-reduce (top_pair):

Mapper:


Input: Line
Key: LongWritable
Value: Text
Output: 
Key: LongWritable (count of A+" "+B)
Value: Text (A+" "+B+" "+the count of A)


Reducer:


Input:
Key: LongWritable (count of A+" "+B)
Value: Text (A+" "+B+" "+the count of A)
Output: 
Key: LongWritable (count of A+" "+B)
Value: Text (A+" "+B+" "+the count of A)


* 4th map-reduce (rel_freq):

Mapper:


Input: Line
Key: LongWritable
Value: Text
Output:
Key: FloatWritable (value of f(B|A))
Value: Text (A+" "+B)

Reducer:


Input:
Key: FloatWritable (value of f(B|A))
Value: Text (A+" "+B)
Output:
Key: FloatWritable (value of f(B|A))
Value: Text (A+" "+B)




ii) The Hadoop cluster settings used, i.e., number of VM instances, number of mappers and reducers, etc.
Ans: 4 VM instances were used. They are all the Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type of amazon aws EC2: t2.small.
4 mappers and 4 reducers were used in the Hadoop cluster.

iii) The running time for your MapReduce approach in both pseudo and fully distributed modes:
Ans: * Pseudo distributed mode: Approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds.
* Fully distributed mode: Approximately 4 minutes.
